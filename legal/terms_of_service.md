Unauthorized Account Use. You agree to notify us immediately at our support channels if you become aware of any unauthorized use of or access to your account. You understand and agree that we may require you to provide information that may be used to confirm your identity and help ensure the security of your account.

## Security and Data Privacy

rmmbr Security. rmmbr aims to keep your data secure by using end-to-end encrypted communication channels, encrypting data at rest, and by ensuring our infrastructure doesn't have direct access to your Secrets. It is also impossible for anyone at rmmbr to access sensitive customer data such as environment variables, rmmbr API keys, and user passwords as the data is end-to-end encrypted. rmmbr regularly assesses its policies and practices to improve its security readiness.

rmmbr implements robust physical, technical and administrative security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorised or accidental access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is entirely free of risk, and thus we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of your information.

Privacy. We collect certain data and information about you in connection with your use of the Services and otherwise in connection with these Terms. We collect and use all such data and information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which you acknowledge. We are always striving to improve the Services. In order to do so, we use analytics techniques to better understand how our Services are being used. For more information on these techniques and the type of data collected, please read our Privacy Policy.

Subpoenas. Nothing in these Terms prevents us from disclosing your data to the extent required by law, subpoenas or court orders, but we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you where permitted to do so. rmmbr strives to balance your privacy rights with other legal requirements.

You agree to immediately update your payment details in Stripe if there is any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and the Services provided to you if any fees or charges remain unpaid. All payments are exclusive of federal, state, local and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments, and you agree to bear and be responsible for the payment of all such charges, excluding taxes based upon rmmbr's net income. We reserve the right to change the fees and other charges from time to time, by notifying you via email or through the Services.
